Ever since I got my first computer a Nintendo Entertainment System I have been fascinated with software. Now many years later software runs the world. Everything from your microwave to your smart phone contains computers. My first desktop computer I got in the 6th grade it was a 486 DX2 66 MHZ Packard Bell. I first got my feet wet with programming with Visual Basic 3.0. 

Programming to me is a art form. Instead of drawing with pencils or painting with a brush I use my thoughts to create code that makes the computer do different things. Coming up with new algorithms is like a form of mathematical poetry that flows from ones mind. Programming gives me a purpose in life and a reason to continue studying, reading and learning. 

I learned to program through trial and error experiences. I read a lot of books and practiced what I read. It took a lot of effort to be able to just open up an IDE and start programming off the top of my head. I have made a lot of projects and learned a lot from them. A lot of the time the purpose of these projects was to learn and not exactly to make a program for other people to use. It takes experience to be a good programmer and I did not like school so I would just come up with projects to help me understand certain concepts and ideas. 

Writing software makes me happy. It is a great stress reliever when you get to work on something that is fun versus for work or school. It makes it easier to code when you enjoy the project your working on. 

All in all programming is something very fun and exciting. There is always something new to learn and the amount of books to read seems endless. It makes life exciting when your learning new things and creating programs that use these technologies. I would recommend to anyone to learn coding. It may be difficult at first but like anything worthwhile it is worth the effort. 

Keep coding,
