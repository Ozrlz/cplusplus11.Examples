Program is simple, 

invoke from the terminal with two arguments, one the source file to
turn into a C++ array and one the output file name. The output file name
will have .cpp and .h appended to the end of it and you use those two
source files in your project to embed the resource. Then there is
memfile.hpp, use this header file to read the array in your program
similar to a file. Rewind, seek, change bytes etc.
